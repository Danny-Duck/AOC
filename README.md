Welcome to my Advent of Code repository written in Rust!

Advent of Code is an annual event in which a series of small programming challenges are released throughout the month of December. These challenges are self-contained and are meant to be completed in order. Each day's challenge builds upon the previous day's, and the final challenge on December 25th is meant to be the most challenging of all.

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges, written in the Rust programming language. I have tried to write efficient and readable code, and I have included comments and documentation to help explain my thought process.

To get started, you will need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you don't already have Rust, you can follow the instructions on the Rust website to install it: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

Once you have Rust installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the root directory. From there, you can use the cargo run command to run the code for a specific day's challenge. For example, to run the code for Day 1, you can use the following command:

`cargo run --bin day1`

You can replace day1 with the name of any of the other bins (e.g. day2, day3, etc.) to run the code for that day's challenge.

Hi Bron,

Hope you had a great weekend. Thanks very much for the offer! 

I've had a look over it and I have a few questions to ask if that's alright?

- Where it says 'inclusive of all allowances and super', what are these allowances? I'm trying to work out how much my take home annual would be.
- It doesn't mention any where working from home, be Spencer had mentioned he would would be working
  from home 2 days a week. Is this still possible? If so, does Wellcom have any home office stipends
  or take home equipment?

Thanks again!

Talk soon,
